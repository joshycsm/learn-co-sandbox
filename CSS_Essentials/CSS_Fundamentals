ID and Class Selectors

ID selectors will target all elements with a specific ID attribute value
The way we specify an ID selector in a CSS rule si to follow the element name with a hash symbol and then the ID attribute value we want to match.
ex: p#introduction {
        color: blue;
    }
ID selectors are useful when you want to give a single element on the page a unique identity and set it apart from everything else.

Class selectors target all elements with a class attribute value matching the selector name.
We specify a class selector using the period symbol followed by the name value.
ex: p.alert {
      color: red;
    }
The diffrence between IDs and classes is that IDs are meant for one element on the page that has a unique identity where class selectors are meant to be spread throughout th epage across multiple elements.

COMPOUND selectors

Compound selectors let us apply the same CSS rules to multiple elements at once.
ex: h1, h2 {
      color: green;
    }
    
DESCENDANT selectors

Decendant selectors target elements that are descendants of the matching selector name.
ex: article p {
      color: blue;
    }
In this case, only p elementss with the article element will recieve styling.

LESS COMMON BUT POWERFUL SELECTORS BELOW

CHILD SELECTORS

The child selector targets all elements that are the immediate children of a specified element.
ex: article > p {
      color: blue;
    }
Only p tags one level down from article will display as blue.
If there are p tags witin an aside element within the article element, they will not recieve the same instruction.

ADJACENT SIBLING selector
The adjacent sibling selector targets elements that appear directly after the matching selector name.
We indicate it using a plus symbol
ex: h3 + p {
      color: blue;
    }
Here the adjacent sibling selector will style the paragraph directly following an h3 element but not paragraphs that come after the first.

GENERAL SIBLING SELECTOR
The general sibling selector (sometimes called the PRECEDED SELECTOR) will style all matched elements after the preceding selector name
ex: h3 ~ p {
      color: red;
    }
With this general sibling selector, all paragraph elements that come after the h3 will recieve the styling.

Universal selector
The universal selector matches any elements and will apply to elemtns that are not targeted by other rules.
It's indicated by the star symbol
ex: * {}
In this case, this is going to set the color of the text yellow for any element that hasn't had its color property specified elsewhere.

Attribute SELECTORS
input[type="text] {}
...main need to refer to the resources to explore them all.

Pseudo-class SELECTORS
Pseudo-class selectors target elements 
The way we signify a Pseudo-class selector is with the colon symbol.
a:link {}
a:visited {}

The Pseudo-class selectors also have alot of aspects so you can explore them more in other resources

Implement Various Types of Color Values in CSS

Hexadecimal Color Values

#000000 black #ffffff white

Traditional RGB colors are on a scale of 0 to 255

RGB Color Values

p {
  color: rgb(255,255,255);
}

You can also add an extra channel to your RGB color by setting an "a" value, which represents opacity...0.5 = 50% opacity o the element will have a somewhat transparent color.
