Identify that nested structures can be mixed
Disscussion of how to model an NDS is what devolopers spend a great number of their meetings and pair programming sessions discussing!

Explain the Entire Vending Machine from the Top Down
We have a coordinate grid. That's an AoA. In each coordinate, there's a "spinner" with mulitple snacks. Each snack has two important facts associated with it, a :name string and a :price Integer.

Explain how the Entire Vending Machine from the Bottom Up 
A price of the snack represented by an 'Integer'
Each snack has a name stored as a 'String'
Each snack collects those facts in a 'Hash' that has keys ':name' and ':price'

Multiple snacks are stored in an indexed collection, an 'Array' that represents the "spinner device. Each "spinner" is accessible by a coordinate within an AoA "grid."
The vending machine is the super-container AoA.

Whichever approach feels more natural to you, feel free to use it.
