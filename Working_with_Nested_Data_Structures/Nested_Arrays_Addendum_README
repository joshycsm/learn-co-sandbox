Recognize that coordinate assignments grow nested Arrays
An array will grow with "nil" values as necessary to accomodate a new coordinate pair addition to an inner Array etc.



Recognize single-coordinate access of Arrays returns an Array
Recognize this! Also, changing any inner array row is just fine.

Conclusion: Understand the "nil" return value versus an actual return value. inner Arrays are Arrays!
