Learning Goals:
Define "Command Line Interface": a text-based conversation with the computer in which we type the commands for : viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer, launching software, and working with devices like printers or networks. The CLI  asks ( or "prompts") the user for a command, the user types it in, and then the computer runs the "sentence" that was typed in. It returns output, too (where appropriate).
Describe the purpose of CLIs: to work with computers remotely, manage files on a file server or web server, automating commonly performed tasks, learn even more about computers.
Identify differences between comand-line interface, terminal emulator, and shell:
The "command-line interface" is used to move files, create directories, and even run programs.
The most important reason to become very familiar with the CLI is this: Tools you will need to be a devloper will require you to use them through the command-line interface.
GUI- Graphical User Interface: Many computer users are familiar with performing actions and executing tasks with THIS instead of CLIs.
WARNING: Commands that list files or create directories are not likely to break anything. Commands that remove files or directories, however, should be used with CAUTION.
